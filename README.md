This documentation is far from complete. If it has made things easier for you to get started playing the 1.13 mod we hereby would like ask you to participate in extending the contents with anything you found missing.

[This page](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md) should give you an insight on how you can participate via GitHub.
